# AnimeCharactersFaceRecognition-unfinished-

I have managed to achieve almost 97% accuracy by using deep neural networks

 
Steps performed in this project:
i)Scrapping images of anime characters from google images.
ii)Face detection of anime characters and image cropping.
iii)Model building using Alexnet CNN


You can see the scrapped images here:

You can see the cropped images after face recognition:

 Now only part remaining is model deployment using Flask Server
